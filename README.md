  ##              Widget Approach                                     ðŸ†š                             Single Page Application(SPA) Approach 
  
  
  
   - Using React to  control only parts of the html pages                                 - Using react to control the entire frontend of a web application.
     or the entire page                                            
                                                                        ðŸ†š 
   -  In this Approach , some pages of a multi-page application                            - Server only sends one html page after that Raect 
     takes over and controls the UI .                                                        will still be rendered on and served by a backend server.
