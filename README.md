## What is REACT & why would  we use React ?
 - React : A javascript library for building user interfaces.
 - Using React   - Using  react makes  web apps feel very much highly interactive to the user.
                 - App responds very instantly .
                 - React helps you not to wait for new pages to load or actions to start.
 - Without React - Whenever you click a link you have to wait for a new page to load & 
                 - when you click a button then, you have to wait for some action to complete.

## What is React.js ?
  - Client-side Javascript library
  - Helps to build modern and reactive user interfaces for the web.
  
## Why React IF WE HAVE JAVASCRIPT ?
   - React mainly helps to  split the application  into small builiding blocks / small components with all component having some clear task they offer codes    to  stay maintained and ,managable and react the library will do all the heavy lifting of rendereing something on screen and of combining all the codes.
    Provides higher level syntax that helps to write codes in a declartative-Component focused way. 
   
  
  ##              Widget Approach                                     ðŸ†š                             Single Page Application(SPA) Approach 
  
  
  
   - Using React to  control only parts of the html pages                                 - Using react to control the entire frontend of a web application.
     or the entire page                                            
                                                                        ðŸ†š 
   -  In this Approach , some pages of a multi-page application                            - Server only sends one html page after that Raect 
     takes over and controls the UI .                                                        will still be rendered on and served by a backend server.
